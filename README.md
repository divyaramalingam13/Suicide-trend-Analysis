# 🧠 I Built a Dashboard for the Dead — Hoping the Living Will Listen
Suicide Trends in India – A Data Dashboard

In 2022, India recorded a heartbreaking 1,64,033 suicides — the highest ever in a single year. Behind these numbers are real people, stories, and pain. As a data analyst, I believe in using my skills to not just visualize trends, but to drive awareness and solutions.

That’s why I built this dashboard — not just to analyze, but to ask: Who is being affected? Why? What can we do better?.
